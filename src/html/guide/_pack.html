      <p>When packing for Mexico, consider the climate and your planned activities. Essential items include lightweight clothing, comfortable walking shoes, a hat, and sunglasses. If visiting during the rainy season, pack a waterproof jacket and umbrella. For beach destinations, bring swimwear, flip-flops, and sunscreen. A reusable water bottle, insect repellent, and a small first-aid kit are also useful. Donâ€™t forget travel documents, such as your passport, visa, and travel insurance details.
