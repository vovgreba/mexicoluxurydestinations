      <p>Mexican culture is rich with traditions and social norms. Greetings typically involve a handshake or a kiss on the cheek, especially among acquaintances. It is customary to address people with titles such as Señor, Señora, or Señorita. When visiting someone's home, bringing a small gift like flowers or sweets is appreciated. Mexicans value politeness and respect; it’s important to use "please" (por favor) and "thank you" (gracias) in conversations. Dressing modestly when visiting churches and rural areas is advised to show respect for local customs.</p>
