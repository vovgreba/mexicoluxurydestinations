      <p>Travelers to Mexico should ensure they are up-to-date on routine vaccines and consider additional vaccinations like hepatitis A and typhoid. Drink bottled or filtered water and avoid ice cubes in places where water purity is uncertain. Street food is delicious but choose vendors with good hygiene practices. Be cautious of crime in urban areas; keep valuables secure and avoid displaying wealth. Familiarize yourself with natural disaster procedures, especially if visiting areas prone to hurricanes or earthquakes. Travel insurance is highly recommended for health coverage and emergencies.</p>
