      <h2 class="title">Visa <span>and</span> Entry Requirements</h2>

      <p>Visitors to Mexico may need a visa depending on their nationality. Check if you need a tourist visa, a business visa, or a special visa for long stays. Ensure your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your planned departure. Additionally, some nationalities may require an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) or an entry permit. It is recommended to check with the Mexican consulate or embassy in your country for specific entry requirements and to apply for the necessary visa well in advance of your trip.</p>
