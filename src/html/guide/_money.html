      <h3>Money Tips</h3>
      <h2 class="title">Currency <span>and</span> Exchange</h2>

      <p>Mexico uses the Mexican Peso (MXN) as its official currency. It is advisable to exchange some money before your trip or upon arrival at the airport. ATMs are widely available in cities and tourist areas, offering convenient access to cash. It's best to use ATMs located inside banks for added security. Credit and debit cards are commonly accepted in hotels, restaurants, and shops, but itâ€™s always good to carry some cash for smaller establishments and markets. Be mindful of exchange rates and any transaction fees that may apply when using your cards.</p>
