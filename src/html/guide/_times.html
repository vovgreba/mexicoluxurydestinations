      <p>Mexico's climate varies significantly across its regions. Coastal areas generally experience warm temperatures year-round, with a rainy season from May to October. Inland regions and highland areas, like Mexico City, have more temperate climates with cooler evenings. The Yucat√°n Peninsula is hot and humid, while the Baja California Peninsula is drier. The best time to visit Mexico depends on your destination and activities. For beach vacations, the dry season from November to April is ideal. For cultural and archaeological sites, the cooler months of October to April are recommended.</p>
